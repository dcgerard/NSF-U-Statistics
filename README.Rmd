    - **Abstract**: Many bioinformatics pipelines include tests for
	  equilibrium. Tests for diploids are well studied and widely
	  available, but extending these approaches to autopolyploids is
	  hampered by the presence of double reduction, the co-migration
	  of sister chromatid segments into the same gamete during
	  meiosis. Though a hindrance for equilibrium tests, double
	  reduction rates are quantities of interest in their own right,
	  as they provide insights about the meiotic behavior of
	  autopolyploid organisms. Here, we develop procedures to (i) test
	  for equilibrium while accounting for double reduction, and (ii)
	  estimate double reduction given equilibrium. To do so, we take
	  two approaches: a likelihood approach, and a novel U-statistic
	  minimization approach that we show generalizes the classical
	  equilibrium Ï‡-squared test in diploids. For small sample sizes and
	  uncertain genotypes, we further develop a bootstrap procedure
	  based on our U-statistic to test for equilibrium. Finally, we
	  highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between random mating
	  and equilibrium in tetraploids at biallelic loci. Our methods
	  are implemented in the hwep R package on GitHub
	  https://github.com/dcgerard/hwep.

## Software

- The `hwep` R package: <https://cran.r-project.org/package=hwep>
    - Inference concerning equilibrium and random mating in
      autopolyploids. Methods are available to test for equilibrium
      and random mating at any even ploidy level (>2) in the presence
      of double reduction at biallelic loci. For autopolyploid
      populations in equilibrium, methods are available to estimate
      the degree of double reduction. We also provide functions to
      calculate genotype frequencies at equilibrium, or after one or
      several rounds of random mating, given rates of double
      reduction. You can read about these methods in @gerard2021double.

- The `phwelike` R package ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.5531955](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5531955)): <https://github.com/dcgerard/phwelike> 
    - This package takes the methods developed and written by
      @jiang2021computational and implements them in the form of an R
      package.  This will allow researchers, such as myself, to better
      compare our methods against those of @jiang2021computational.

## Reproducible Research

- Results from @gerard2021double ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.5531872](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5531872)): <https://github.com/dcgerard/hwesims>
    - This code repository contains all the scripts necessary to reproduce
      the results from @gerard2021double. We emphasize extreme reproducibilty 
      by providing executable, and linked, code and data.
